## üîß Hardware Setup Overview  

I‚Äôm starting with a **single-node** setup for initial testing before expanding to a **mini cluster**.  

- **Power via PoE:** Using an existing **Ubiquiti USW Pro Max 16 PoE** switch to power the Pi 5 through the PoE HAT.  
- **Storage:** NVMe SSD connected via the **Waveshare PoE M.2 HAT (B)** adapter.  
- **RTC:** Backup battery maintains system time and enables wake-up from halt.  
- **Cluster goal:** Validate NVMe boot, firmware stability, and PoE operation before scaling to multiple Pi 5 nodes.

## ‚ö° Power Consumption Summary
Measurements taken from the **Ubiquiti USW Pro Max 16 PoE** switch PoE monitoring interface:

| State | Average Power Draw | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|--------|
| **Idle / Light Load** | ~6 W | Normal operation at idle, headless or SSH access. |
| **High Load / Boot / Update** | ~9.5 W | Peak observed during firmware update and NVMe access. |
| **Shutdown / Standby (PoE Board only)** | ~1.0 W | Power consumption when Raspberry Pi 5 is halted but PoE HAT remains powered. |

> Total daily PoE energy usage for single-node setup: **‚âà137 Wh**, based on continuous 24-hour operation.

## üß∞ Setup & Installation Notes

### üñ•Ô∏è Console Access via JetKVM
For setup, I used a **JetKVM** device for full remote access:
- **USB 2.0** ‚Üí Keyboard + Mouse emulation  
- **Micro-HDMI ‚Üí HDMI adapter** ‚Üí Display  
- **Web interface:** [https://app.jetkvm.com](https://app.jetkvm.com)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Tip:  
> Full keyboard + mouse emulation caused a pre-boot lockup.  
> Switching JetKVM to **keyboard-only mode** fixed the issue.

---

### üíæ OS Imaging & Firmware Preparation
1. Used **Raspberry Pi Imager** to write  
   ‚Üí **Debian GNU/Linux 13 (Trixie) ARM64 Lite** to an **SD card**.  
2. Booted from the SD card and ran updates:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
   sudo rpi-update
   ```
3. Updated the **Pi 5 firmware** to the latest stable release.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è PCIe & NVMe Configuration
When testing the **Waveshare PoE M.2 HAT (B)**:
- **PCIe Gen 3** caused instability and incomplete NVMe detection.  
- Switching to **PCIe Gen 2** resolved it and the NVMe was detected successfully.

Add this line to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:
```bash
dtparam=pciex1
```

---

### üöÄ Migrating OS from SD Card to NVMe
Once NVMe was stable, I cloned the OS to the NVMe drive.

Then:
1. Set boot order to **NVMe first** in firmware.  
2. Reboot ‚Üí system boots cleanly from NVMe.
3. Configure user and password for the new OS.  
4. Shutdown and remove the SD card ‚úÖ

### üîã RTC & Power Configuration
After successful NVMe boot:
- Enabled **RTC battery charging**  
  ‚Üí [Official guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#enable-battery-charging)  
- Enabled **battery alarm wake-up** from halt.  
- Verified RTC retains time across full power loss.

## üß© Future Plans ‚Äì Cluster Expansion
- Add **2‚Äì4 additional Pi 5 nodes**, each powered via PoE.  
- Centralised management and provisioning (PXE / NVMe boot).  
- Explore **Kubernetes**, **Docker Swarm**, or **Nomad** for orchestration.  
- Implement shared storage (NFS / GlusterFS) and monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana).
